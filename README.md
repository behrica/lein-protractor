# lein-protractor

A Leiningen plugin to execute AngularJS integration tests with Protractor (https://github.com/angular/protractor)

This plugins support the idea of integration tests so it does up to three things:

1. Starting a selenium server
2. Starting your app server with the leiningen ring plugin
   3. This might call a init method, which can be used to setup teh database for example

-> Afterwards it shuts all down

## Usage


Put `[lein-protractor "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.


    $ lein protractor

It can be configured by this keys in project.clj:

    :ring {:handler todo.web/app}       ; handler function, which will be started by ring server
    :protractor {:init todo.db/init-db  ; function to be executed by ring plugin when ring server starts
         :chromedriver "/home/xxxxx/bin/chromedriver"
         :protractorconfig "resources/protractor_conf.js" }
